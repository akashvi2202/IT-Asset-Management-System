# IT-Asset-Management-System
The primary objective of this project is to develop an intuitive and robust web portal that
facilitates the efficient handling of asset-related tasks and gate pass management. The system
aims to provide a unified platform for:
● Asset Management: Enabling users to search for, insert, update, and delete asset records
efficiently. This includes tracking various asset details such as asset IDs, descriptions,
locations, and status.
● Gate Pass Management: Allowing users to manage gate pass entries, including adding
new entries and searching for existing ones. This functionality ensures that access control
is well-documented and that security protocols are adhered to.
● Reporting: Generating detailed reports for both assets and gate passes, providing insights
into asset utilization and access patterns, which aids in decision-making and operational
planning.
